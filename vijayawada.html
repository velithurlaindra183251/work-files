      Vijayawada is a city in the southeast Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It's
      known for the ornate Kanaka Durga Temple, which sits atop a hill
      overlooking the city. The Undavalli Caves feature ancient rock-cut
      temples, carved out of a sandstone hillside and adorned with elaborate
      statues. The massive Prakasam Barrage stretches across the Krishna River.
      Nearby is Bhavani Island, with forests and waterfront gardens.
